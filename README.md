# Data Structures and Algorithms

A curated collection of classic data structures and algorithms implemented across multiple languages.

## Implementations
- Arrays and linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Binary search trees
- Graph representations
- Searching algorithms (linear, binary, DFS)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick)

## Languages
- Python
- C
- Java

## Goals
- Strengthen algorithmic intuition
- Compare implementations across languages
- Emphasize time and space complexity awareness
